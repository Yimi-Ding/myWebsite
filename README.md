🌐 My Web Design Adventure 🌐  

Welcome to my web design playground! 🎉 Here, you’ll find a collection of four HTML pages and one CSS stylesheet, each crafted with creativity, style, and a focus on responsive design.   
From a personalized index page to a project showcase, a resume, and a contact page, this collection represents my journey through flexible layouts, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to create a seamless experience across all devices.  

Take a peek, explore the code, and maybe even catch a bit of inspiration along the way. Let’s make the web a more beautiful (and responsive) place together! 💻📱✨  

Enjoy your stay, and happy coding! 😄
