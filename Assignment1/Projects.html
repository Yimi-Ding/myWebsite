                <h2>Tool Rental Management System</h2>
                <p class="details">October 2024, Database System Course, Algonquin College, Ottawa, ON</p>

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>The Tool Rental Management System is a database application designed to simplify the management of tool rentals. 
                    Built using Microsoft Access and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), 
                    this system allows rental companies to keep track of tool categories, individual tools, rental transactions, 
                    maintenance records, and staff involvement. 
                    It provides an organized, efficient way to handle tool availability, rental history, and maintenance needs.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tool Categories and Inventory Management: Organizes tools into categories, enabling users to easily find and manage tool types.</li>
                    <li>Rental Transactions: Tracks detailed information about each rental, including the renter, rental period, fees, and the tools rented.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance Records: Logs maintenance activities for each tool, ensuring tools are in safe, working condition before being rented out.</li>
                    <li>Staff Management: Records staff members involved in rental and maintenance processes, promoting accountability and efficient tracking.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Use Cases</h3>
                <p>This system is ideal for companies renting out tools and equipment, as it improves organization, enhances tracking of rentals and returns, and ensures timely maintenance. 
                    By streamlining these processes, the Tool Rental Management System helps maintain an efficient workflow and ensures high customer satisfaction through better service management.</p>

                <h2>Baggage Checking Simulation Program</h2>
                <p class="details">July 2024, Computer Programming Course, Algonquin College, Ottawa, ON</p>
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>The Baggage Checking Simulation Program is a Java-based application where users input 
                baggage dimensions (length, width, height) and weight. The program checks these entries against airline 
                standards, helping airlines manage baggage more efficiently by reducing issues with non-compliant luggage.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Baggage Input: Users can enter details for multiple pieces of baggage, with each entry creating a Baggage object.</li>
                    <li>Compliance Check: The program validates each baggage entry against airline size and weight limits, providing immediate feedback on compliance.</li>
                    <li>Detailed Output: After all entries, the program displays details and compliance results for each piece of baggage.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Use Cases</h3>
                <p>This simulation is useful for training airline staff or as part of a larger baggage management system, enhancing the efficiency of baggage checks for ground personnel.</p>

                <h2>Passion for baking: Canelé</h2>
                    <p>Canelé is a small French pastry originating from the Bordeaux region. 
                    The exterior is caramelized and deeply browned, creating a crisp shell. 
                    Inside, it is soft with a rich vanilla flavor and a subtle hint of rum. 
                    The contrast between the crispy outer layer and the tender, moist interior 
                    is what defines the Canelé.</p>
                    <p>I also make desserts like swiss rolls and tiramisu and I've designed a logo for my bakery--Hachi Bakery.
                    In case someday I have my own.</p>
